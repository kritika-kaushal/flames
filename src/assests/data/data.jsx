      desc: "Energy takers can manifest in many ways, from the negative Nancy at work to the never—ending pile of laundry that seems to multiply faster than rabbits.",
      category: "Life",
      content: "Energy is one of the most important aspects of our lives, and it can come from many different sources. When you feel tired or sluggish, you may attribute that to lack of sleep, improper nutrition or maybe a cup of coffee you had that wasn’t nearly strong enough. It’s easy to think that if you aren’t feeling energized, you need to alter your physical state. But there is a whole other world of energy that can be harnessed solely from inspiration and true joy. Think back to the last time you had a crush and how just a text from them would give you an insane amount of energy. That’s the kind of energy we’re talking about here. The art of energizing yourself is about tapping into this source of energy and learning how to harness it to improve your life. At one point or another, you may have had a friend who left you feeling like you’ve just run a marathon after spending time with them. Or maybe you have certain tasks that you avoid like the plague because they drain you of your energy. This is where the concept of energy givers and energy takers comes in. Energy givers are the people, activities, and experiences that leave you feeling energized, fulfilled, and excited about life. This could be spending time with loved ones or trying out a new hobby.",

      category: "Fashion",
      content: "Featured in Prince of Wales check, herringbone, or houndstooth wool, the trend adopts a more relaxed approach to power dressing. Undoubtedly influenced by the excess and menswear inspired trends of the 1980’s, (see Giorgio Armani’s 1980s suiting), the trend can most significantly be taken note from Spring 2016 runway shows including, Celine, Michael Kors and Balenciaga.Reminiscent of military and maritime uniforms featuring menswear checks, the new womenswear trend highlights an emphasis on the oversized, and occasionally genderless, structure, and proportion. Balenciaga’s Fall 2016 RTW Collection most notably highlights these key characteristics with accentuated shoulders and an emphasis on the exaggeration of the hips and waist. Although inspired by masculine influences and nostalgic mannish trends, the trend adopts a retro-futuristic approach, adapting the chequered wool for the modern woman, evoking newness, and the strong female form. A trend built around creating an outfit inspired by retro, but in a futurist approach for the modern women, the luxury lies in how one adopts the trend to their own style and wardrobe. Whether adopting the traditional blazer, straight leg trousers or matching power suit, incorporating exaggerated proportions and playing with different pattern, sizes and mixing neutral colours elevate the trend from the predictable, corporate connotations to undoubtedly chic..",

      desc: "The Western Conference playoffs are here, and the Phoenix Suns have the shortest odds at every sportsbook to win the conference. But are they really the team to beat? ",
      category: "Sport",
      content: "Let’s start with the obvious about the 2023 Suns heading into the postseason, in fact who better to quote than King LeBron James when referring to one of his Cavaliers rosters from a half decade ago “top heavy as bleep.” The Suns, led by superstar wings, Devin Booker and Kevin Durant. But despite their talent, there are plenty of reasons why they shouldn't be considered the undoubted odds on favorites to win the Western conference heading into the playoffs; and more why there undoubtedly remains more questions than answers about their legitimacy. First and foremost, it remains to be seen whether the, the Suns lack of emphasis on the regular season this year will be to their detriment - since the core four of Booker, Durant, Paul, and Ayton played less games together as a unit than you or I could count on both hands. Will the chemistry - or lack there of - be good enough right away in life-and-death, sweaty- palm 4th quarter situations in postseason play? My pet dog could deduce that the Suns will have to rely heavily on their superstar duo of wings because - I know…shocking - superstar players are ultimately what almost always wins playoff series’; which is why undoubtedly the Suns needed to put all their eggs in one basket, and get a generational player such as Durant, especially considering last postseason’s flame out. The suns were not going to the finals without at least going for broke and make this blockbuster trade.",
